## Games

**[Alien Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Garden)** (1982) by [Bernie DeKoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_De_Koven) and [Jaron Lanier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier)

> With a heavy emphasis on the artistic aspects of computer-generated simulation, Alien Garden was described by its creators as an art game. At a time when the art game genre had not yet been recognized as even emergent, Alien Garden ranks among the very earliest art games. Indeed, its release predates Lanier's more famous art game, Moondust (often characterized as the first true art game), by a year.
